# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project includes a basic web page containing a picture of me and some basic information about me.

## Running

To run this website, you can right click on the index.html file and click the 'show preview' option. While this web server is running, the url shown in the preview can be used in a web browser as well. The web browser is required for the Say Hello pop-up to work.
